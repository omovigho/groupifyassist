Place your exported screenshot file as `public/visual-ref.png`.

Notes
- Recommended size: 1920x1080 or higher for crisp hero background.
- Keep file size under ~500KB for faster loads (compress with an image tool if needed).
- The page will automatically show it behind the gradient/particles if present.
- If you want to disable the screenshot background, simply remove or rename the file.
